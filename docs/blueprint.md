## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5), reflecting the collaborative nature of academic exploration and discovery. This will be suitable on both a light and dark background.
- Background color: Very light blue-gray (#F5F6FA) for a clean, accessible interface that puts information and connections front and center. Using the same base blue hue as the primary establishes a subtle visual connection.
- Accent color: Soft teal (#4CAF50), an analogous hue shifted toward green, to provide clear visual contrast without being distracting.
- Clean and modern typography with good readability.
- Use clear, simple icons to represent different interests and activities.
- Subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience.
